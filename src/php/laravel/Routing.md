# Routing

To get started, let's create our first route. In Laravel, the simplest route is a route to a Closure. Pop open the `app/routes.php` file and add the following route to the bottom of the file:

```php
Route::get('users', function()
{
    return 'Users!';
});
```

Now, if you hit the `/users` route in your web browser, you should see `Users!` displayed as the response. Great! You've just created your first route.

Routes can also be attached to controller classes. For example:

```php
    Route::get('users', 'UserController@getIndex');
```

This route informs the framework that requests to the `/users` route should call the `getIndex` method on the `UserController` class. For more information on controller routing, check out the controller documentation
