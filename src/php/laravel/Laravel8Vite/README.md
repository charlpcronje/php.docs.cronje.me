Make sure to place the `~/.composer/vendor/bin directory in your PATH (or C:\%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin` if working with Windows) so the laravel executable is found when you run the laravel command in your terminal.

Once installed, the simple `laravel new` command will create a fresh Laravel installation in the directory you specify. For instance, `laravel new blog` would create a directory named `blog` containing a fresh Laravel installation with all dependencies installed.
