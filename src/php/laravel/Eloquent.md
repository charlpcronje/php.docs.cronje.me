# Eloquent ORM

Laravel ships with a superb ORM: Eloquent. If you have used the Ruby on Rails framework, you will find Eloquent familiar, as it follows the ActiveRecord ORM style of database interaction.

First, let's define a model. An Eloquent model can be used to query an associated database table, as well as represent a given row within that table. Don't worry, it will all make sense soon! Models are typically stored in the `app/models` directory. Let's define a `User.php` model in that directory like so:

```php
    class User extends Eloquent {}
```

Note that we do not have to tell Eloquent which table to use. Eloquent has a variety of conventions, one of which is to use the plural form of the model name as the model's database table. Convenient!

Using your preferred database administration tool, insert a few rows into your `users` table, and we'll use Eloquent to retrieve them and pass them to our view.

Now let's modify our `/users` route to look like this:

```php
    Route::get('users', function()
    {
        $users = User::all();

        return View::make('users')->with('users', $users);
    });
```

Let's walk through this route. First, the `all` method on the `User` model will retrieve all of the rows in the `users` table. Next, we're passing these records to the view via the `with` method. The `with` method accepts a key and a value, and is used to make a piece of data available to a view.

Awesome. Now we're ready to display the users in our view!
