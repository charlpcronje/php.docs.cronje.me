# Migrations

To create a table to hold our data, we'll use the Laravel migration system. Migrations let you expressively define modifications to your database, and easily share them with the rest of your team.

First, let's configure a database connection. You may configure all of your database connections from the `app/config/database.php` file. By default, Laravel is configured to use MySQL, and you will need to supply connection credentials within the database configuration file. If you wish, you may change the `driver` option to `sqlite` and it will use the SQLite database included in the `app/database` directory.

Next, to create the migration, we'll use the [Artisan CLI](/docs/4.2/artisan). From the root of your project, run the following from your terminal:

```shell
    php artisan migrate:make create_users_table
```

Next, find the generated migration file in the `app/database/migrations` folder. This file contains a class with two methods: `up` and `down`. In the `up` method, you should make the desired changes to your database tables, and in the `down` method you simply reverse them.

Let's define a migration that looks like this:

```php
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('users', function($table)
        {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->string('email')->unique();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::drop('users');
    }
```

Next, we can run our migrations from our terminal using the `migrate` command. Simply execute this command from the root of your project:

```shell
    php artisan migrate
```

If you wish to rollback a migration, you may issue the `migrate:rollback` command. Now that we have a database table, let's start pulling some data!
